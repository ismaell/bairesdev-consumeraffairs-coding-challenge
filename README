Deployment for testing
======================
Using a virtualenv is recommended. See:
<https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/venv.html>

Dependencies are specified in requirements.txt; to install use:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

WARNING: The application is with debugging features enabled, and sqlite
database, so should not be deployed in production without prior configuration.

Migrations must be applied first:

	python3 manage.py migrate

Then you can test the project by running:

	python3 manage.py runserver

It will run on <http://localhost:8000/> by default.



Setting up users
================
A superuser must be created first; e.g:

	python3 manage.py createsuperuser \
		--username admin --email admin@localhost

With this user created you can then add more users from the admin interface
at <http://localhost:8000/admin/>.



Tests
=====
A few tests are included, you can run these with:

	python3 manage.py test



The Interface
=============
The entry point is at <http://localhost:8000/review/>. The application
requires users to be logged in for all purposes.

There it will show the list of reviews by the current user, and a form to
enter new ones.

The admin interface at <http://localhost:8000/admin/> provides staff members
with access to all reviews.


Enjoy.
